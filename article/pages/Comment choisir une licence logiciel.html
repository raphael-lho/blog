    <p><j class="courttexteformation">A software license is a contract, 
        by which the owner of the rights in the software authorizes a 
        third party to do acts that would otherwise infringe those rights</j></p><br>
    
    
    
        <h2 class="texte_auto-formation"><p><j class="texteformation">It is a contract between a person installing software affected by this type</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">of license on one/their computer and the software publisher. </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">Most of them, also called proprietary software licenses, </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">limit the number of machines on which the software can be installed,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">the number of users who can use the software, </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">and contain other limitations that are not essential to the technology.</j></p>

            <p><j class="texteformation">The recognition of the copyright to the owner of a software confers to the latter the possibility.</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">to do what he wants with his thing, whether it is tangible or intangible. The latter can therefore perfectly,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">if he wishes, make his software available to the public. But for that, </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">it is still necessary to legally frame the license by a contract,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">in order to protect the co-contracting parties. This contract will then allow the owner to delimit the use of his software,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation"> by defining the type of right granted, the extent of this right, the number of users per license, or the volume of use.</j></p>


            <img class="autoformation" src="../../img/licence2.jfif" />
    
            <p><j class="texteformation">The following is a list of strongly recommended clauses for a software license agreement:</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">Definitions:</j></p>
            <br>
            <p><j class="texteformation">- "Licensor" is the one who grants the user a right to use his software.</j></p>
            <br>
            <p><j class="texteformation">- The "User" or "Licensee" is the one who enjoys the right to use the Licensor's software.</j></p>
            <br>
            <p><j class="texteformation">- The "Software" means the software created by the Licensor, the use of which is made available to the User.</j></p>


            <img class="autoformation" src="../../img/licence3.png" />
    
            
            <p><j class="texteformation">→	The proprietary license: traditionally used by commercial software 	publishers,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">this type of software license is accompanied by clauses </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">intended to restrict the freedoms granted to the user such as a use subject to royalty, a ban on copying the software,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">accessing its source code, modifying it and distributing it. The objective is to maximize </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">the value of the economic rights attached to the software in order </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">to	generate direct revenue from the granting of licenses to users;</j></p>
            <br>
            <p><j class="texteformation">→	The free license: the term "free" should not be understood in the</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">sense of free. It means the freedom to use the software, </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">to access its source code for any purpose (to study how the program works,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation"> to adapt it to one's needs, or to correct errors), </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">and the freedom to distribute copies of the software for free or for a fee. Therefore,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation"> a license that excludes any of these freedoms cannot be called free;</j></p>
            <br>
            <p><j class="texteformation">→	The hybrid license: this is a mixture of the free and proprietary license.</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation"> Thus, it can authorize the use, the copy and the availability </j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">of the source code while prohibiting the distribution of the software.</j></p>
            <br>
            <p><j class="texteformation">It is therefore essential to simplify the situation by defining</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation"> common rules for purchasing licenses for the entire company</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation">and to sign master purchase agreements with suppliers. Microsoft,</j></p>
            <p><j class="texteformation"> for example, offers various group purchase agreements that should be studied.</j></p>
            <br>
            <p><j class="texteformation">Within the same publisher, the forms of licenses are numerous and evolve rapidly over time.</j></p>
